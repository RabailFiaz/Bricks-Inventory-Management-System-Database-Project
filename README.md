## Project Overview
The Brick Inventory Management System is designed to streamline the management of inventory, orders, customers, sales, and employees in the brick manufacturing and distribution sector. This system facilitates efficient data handling and retrieval, ensuring that users can easily manage their operations.

---

## Features
- Comprehensive database structure with multiple interconnected tables.
- Capability for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
- A variety of SQL queries that demonstrate data manipulation and retrieval techniques.

---

## Setup Instructions
To set up the Brick Inventory Management System, follow these steps:

1. Install a compatible Database Management System (DBMS) such as MySQL.
2. Create the database and its tables as specified in the project files.
3. Populate the tables with sample data provided in the project.

---

## Usage
After setting up the database, users can execute SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data. This can be done using a SQL client or command line interface.

---

## Database Structure

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The ERD visually represents the entities involved in the database and their relationships, illustrating how tables such as BrickInventory, Orders, and Customers are interconnected.

---

### Relational Schema
The relational schema outlines the structure of each table, including the fields and data types for every entity involved in the system.

---

## Data Manipulation
This section includes descriptions of the types of data operations that can be performed, covering both Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations.

---

## SQL Queries

### Joins
Different types of joins are utilized to extract data from multiple tables, allowing users to combine related information based on common attributes.

### Nested Queries
Nested queries enable users to perform complex data retrieval by embedding one query within another, enhancing the ability to filter results based on specific conditions.

### Correlated Queries
Correlated queries reference data from the outer query, allowing for dynamic filtering based on related records, making it possible to derive more contextual insights.
